# Algorand.dev

My journey as a decentralized app developer on Algorand.

## Notes

When reading *global state* of an application, values can have one of the following types. This information comes from the `TealType` enum in PyTeal.

```
0 – uint64
1 – bytes
2 – anytype
3 – none
```

When an application is deployed, it gets a unique *Application ID*.
